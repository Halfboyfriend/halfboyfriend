**ABOUT ME

- Hi, Iâ€™m Owoyemi! I'm a software developer. In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within both front-end & back-end web, I guess that makes me a full-stack developer and the main languages in my tech stack are C, Php/Mysqli, Sql, Javascript, and of course HTML/CSS. Iâ€™m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python! and also a student of ALX Africa) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in Lagos City, Nigeria.
